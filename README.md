Project Summary
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to optimize a pharmaceutical manufacturing process. By analyzing historical batch data, a predictive model was developed to forecast final product yield and identify the most influential process parameters.

# Methodology
Data Simulation: A synthetic dataset was created to mimic real-world manufacturing data, including key process variables like temperature, pressure, and catalyst concentration.

# Exploratory Analysis:
Data visualization was used to identify correlations and relationships between process parameters and the final yield.

# Model Building: A Random Forest Regressor model was trained to predict the yield percentage based on the process parameters.

# Key Findings & Model Performance
The predictive model achieved strong performance, with an R-squared (R 2 ) of 0.82 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.78%. This means the model can explain 82% of the variance in the yield and is, on average, within 1.78 percentage points of the actual yield.

The feature importance analysis revealed the most critical variables for yield optimization:

Temperature and Stirring Speed were found to be the most significant factors influencing yield.

Catalyst Concentration was also a major contributor.

pH and Pressure had a comparatively minor impact.

# Business Impact
This project showcases how advanced analytics can deliver direct business value in a manufacturing setting. The predictive model can be used to:

Optimize process settings before a new batch begins to maximize yield and reduce waste.

Perform root-cause analysis for low-yield batches by identifying which key parameters were out of their optimal range.

Guide R&D efforts by highlighting the most critical variables for further investigation and process control.

This project demonstrates the ability to translate complex data into actionable insights, a key skill for a role in advanced analytics.
